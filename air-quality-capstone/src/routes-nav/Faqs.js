						<h3>What is the U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI)?</h3>

						<p>The U.S. AQI is EPAâ€™s index for reporting air quality.</p>

						<h3>Why should I sign up for email alerts and what level should they be at?</h3>

						<p>
							Our email alert system sends your inbox a message including the information of your
							preferred ZIP code's air quality. You have a choice of what severity triggers the email
							response. We suggest unhealthy for sensitive groups but it is up to you if and when you want
							these emails.
						</p>

						<h3>How does the AQI work?</h3>

						<p>
							Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the
							greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI
							value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents
							hazardous air quality.
						</p>

						<p>
							For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration
							that equals the level of the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection
							of public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When
							AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain sensitive groups of
							people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.
						</p>

						<p>
							The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category corresponds to a different level of
							health concern. Each category also has a specific color. The color makes it easy for people
							to quickly determine whether air quality is reaching unhealthy levels in their communities.

						<h3>Five major pollutants</h3>

						<p>
							EPA establishes an AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act. Each of
							these pollutants has a national air quality standard set by EPA to protect public health:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>ground-level ozone</li>
							<li>particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10)</li>
							<li>carbon monoxide</li>
							<li>sulfur dioxide</li>
							<li>nitrogen dioxide</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Fire not appearing on Firetracker?</h3>

					<p>
						We recieve our fire information from NASA's Earth Observatory Natural Even Tracker (EONET).
						Often times it takes a few days for natural events to register on their information. If a fire
						is close to you and is not listed on the tracker, your AQI search result should still be
						accurate.
